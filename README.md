**Description for Number Plate Detection**

Number plate detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating vehicle license plates within digital images or video streams.
This process typically includes several stages: image acquisition, preprocessing (such as noise reduction and contrast enhancement), object detection to locate the plate region,
and optical character recognition (OCR) to extract the alphanumeric characters from the detected plate. Applications of number plate detection include traffic monitoring,
automated toll collection, parking management, and law enforcement.
